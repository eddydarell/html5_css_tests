            <h3>Plot</h3>
            <p>Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization, led by the humans, faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying world of Draenor to find their place in another. As a gateway known as the Dark Portal opens to connect the two worlds, the humans face destruction while the orcs face extinction. Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), leader of the humans, and Durotan (Toby Kebbell), leader of the orcs, are then sent on a collision course that will decide the fate of their families, their people and their home.</p>

            <h3>Production</h3>
            <p>The project was officially announced in May of 2006[6] and was originally set in the era of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans. This setting, however, was later dropped, with Blizzard feeling that it would be too similar to The Lord of the Rings[9] Initially set for a 2009 release, the film was later delayed to 2011,[10] However by Comicon 2011 the film was announced to still be in the "Treatment stage"".[11]
            Uwe Boll made a bid to direct, but was turned away by Blizzard, who he claims to have said, "We will not sell the movie rights, not to you… especially not to you. Because it’s such a big online game success, maybe a bad movie would destroy that ongoing income, what the company has with it."[12] Sam Raimi was initially attached to direct,[13][14] but was replaced by Duncan Jones in January 2013.[15] Upon coming aboard Jones immediately voiced his displeasure at the script, which he stated "was the stale fantasy trope of, humans are the good guys, monsters are the bad guys," with Blizzard's approval (who had also been looking to change the story) Jones changed the story so that "It’s 50-50." [16] Jones also faced personal struggles during filming as his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer soon after Jones took over, furthermore his father, David Bowie, also died from cancer late in production. Jones thus summed up the challenge by telling The New York Times. "My film started and ended with cancer" [16]At San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, a concept trailer was presented, featuring a battle between a human and an orc.</p>
